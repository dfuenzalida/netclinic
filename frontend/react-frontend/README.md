This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the NextJS server on port 8000 which is configured on `package.json`, however, if you open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser, this will be missing the backend API.

To run the whole development environment, follow the *Development* section of the top-level [README.md](../../README.md#development) to launch the database, backend and front-end for the complete development setup.
